# Market 3: Community Centered Marketplace

## What's wrong with Ebay?

**Scammers are everywhere**. There is no easy and verifiable way to prove someone isn’t a scammer with centralized marketplaces and accounts. You can easily create an account, scam someone, and then delete your account.

**No privacy**: when selling on Facebook. Do you really want your friends knowing you make a ton of money flipping plants?

**You don’t own your account or listings**. Sellers can be banned and lose their livelihood. And your listings are owned by Ebay. Sellers waste hours manually cross-listing and delisting on different marketplaces and groups.

## How can we solve this?

Our project revolves around **Trust**. Blockchains offers a treasure trove of data that is easy to validate and hard to fudge (history is immutable). You can bring your history and identity to you wherever you go!

There are two components to our project:
    * WalletScan: a suite of APIs that can shows the holistic profile of an address. Anyone can now quickly look up if a wallet address is trust worthy in real time instead of going through pages of Etherscan Logs
    * Market3 Magic Protocol: a smart contract that gives you control of which communities do you want to buy from or sell to!
